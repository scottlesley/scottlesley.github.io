                <p>
                    People who have been smoking for a long period of time are finding it harder to
stop their habit. Nicotine withdrawals leave the smoker craving another cigarette causing harmful side
effects to them and those around them. Our solution to this problem will provide users with an easy
way to remind themselves of their goal and prevent them from giving in.

                    My team had brainstormed a few ideas on how we can solve our problem statement of how we can stop people from smoking. We decided to put our ideas on a jamboard.
